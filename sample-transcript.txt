Weekly Product Team Sync - October 16, 2024

Participants: Alex (PM), Sarah (Designer), Mike (Engineer), Lisa (Marketing)

[00:01:30]
Alex: Good morning everyone! Let's start with our weekly sync. First item on the agenda - the Q4 roadmap.

[00:02:15]
Mike: I've been working on the user authentication refactor. We decided to move forward with OAuth 2.0 implementation. It should be ready by end of this week.

[00:03:00]
Alex: Perfect. Sarah, can you prepare the design mockups for the new dashboard by Friday? We need them for the client presentation next week.

[00:03:30]
Sarah: Yes, I'll have them ready. I'm also working on the mobile responsive designs. Should be done by Wednesday.

[00:04:45]
Lisa: Just a quick update - our marketing campaign for the product launch went live yesterday. We're already seeing good engagement numbers.

[00:05:20]
Alex: That's great news! Mike, we need to discuss the API rate limiting issue that came up last week. What's the status?

[00:06:00]
Mike: I've identified the bottleneck. It's in the database query optimization. I'll need to schedule a meeting with the DevOps team to discuss scaling options.

[00:07:15]
Alex: Okay, let's set that up. Sarah, one more thing - we need to revisit the color scheme for the new feature. The stakeholders had some concerns.

[00:07:45]
Sarah: I saw their feedback. I'll prepare 3 alternative color palettes by Monday for review.

[00:08:30]
Lisa: Should we prepare a press release for the upcoming feature launch? We should get it out before the end of the month.

[00:09:00]
Alex: Yes, definitely. Lisa, can you draft that and share it with the team by next Thursday?

[00:09:30]
Mike: One last thing - we decided to deprecate the old API endpoints. We'll keep them running until December 1st to give partners time to migrate.

[00:10:00]
Alex: Perfect. Let's wrap up. Great work everyone! Same time next week?

All: Agreed!
